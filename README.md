# Kaleidoscope-CapsLock

Are you ever ANGRY?

Do you ever encounter people who are WRONG on the INTERNET?

Do you write code with CONSTANTS?

Do you adhere to a style guide in which things like movie titles are written in ALL CAPS?

If any or all of those are true, Kaleidoscope-CapsLock is the plugin for you!

This is a plugin for [Kaleidoscope](https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope) that 
enables traditional Caps Lock functionality on your keyboard, along with LED effects to
indicate when this mode is in effect.

## How to use:

Put it in your include directives:

```
...
// Support for LED Caps Lock mode
#include "Kaleidoscope-CapsLock.h"
...
```

Add Key_CapsLock somewhere in your keymap (e.g. in the FUNCTION keymap in the same
positions as the shift keys in your regular keymap):

```

  [FUNCTION] =  KEYMAP_STACKED
  (___,      Key_F1,           Key_F2,      Key_F3,     Key_F4,        Key_F5,           XXX,
   Key_Tab,  ___,              Key_mouseUp, ___,        Key_mouseBtnR, Key_mouseWarpEnd, Key_mouseWarpNE,
   Key_Home, Key_mouseL,       Key_mouseDn, Key_mouseR, Key_mouseBtnL, Key_mouseWarpNW,
   Key_End,  Key_PrintScreen,  Key_Insert,  ___,        Key_mouseBtnM, Key_mouseWarpSW,  Key_mouseWarpSE,
   ___, Key_Delete, ___, Key_CapsLock,
   ___,

   Consumer_ScanPreviousTrack, Key_F6,                 Key_F7,                   Key_F8,                   Key_F9,          Key_F10,          Key_F11,
   Consumer_PlaySlashPause,    Consumer_ScanNextTrack, Key_LeftCurlyBracket,     Key_RightCurlyBracket,    Key_LeftBracket, Key_RightBracket, Key_F12,
                               Key_LeftArrow,          Key_DownArrow,            Key_UpArrow,              Key_RightArrow,  ___,              ___,
   Key_PcApplication,          Consumer_Mute,          Consumer_VolumeDecrement, Consumer_VolumeIncrement, ___,             Key_Backslash,    Key_Pipe,
   Key_CapsLock, ___, Key_Enter, ___,
   ___)


```

And then put it in the Kaleidoscope.use() directive in setup():

```
    ...
    // The breathe effect slowly pulses all of the LEDs on your keyboard
    &LEDBreatheEffect,

    // The CapsLock plugin lights up CAPS LOCK mode in a similar way to numpad mode
    &CapsLock,
    ...
```

Once you have compiled and flashed your firmware, you can activate Caps Lock by pressing
fn-shift (or whatever key binding you choose to map to Key_CapsLock). It will remain
active until you repeat the same keypress. Kaleidoscope-CapsLock is not affected by the
state of the unmodified shift key. The behavior of the shift modifier while Caps Lock is
active will be OS dependent.

## Alternatives:

Because Kaleidoscope-CapsLock relies on the host operating system for implementation,
it may not do exactly what *you* want in all cases. One distinction is that it will not
affect the shift state of number keys. If that's the behavior you have in mind, check
out [Kaleidoscope-OneShot](https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope-OneShot).
Kaleidoscope-OneShot mimics holding down a specific modifier key by hand (e.g. the shift
key), and thus it affects the state of every key pressed while the OneShot modifier is
active.
